# Blades (HTML CLIENT)

This is the HTML you all know and love...

## Dependencies

This is a cactus project. THAT'S RIGHT. https://github.com/koenbok/Cactus

You need it.

`cactus serve` from this directory after you pull it down.

## TODO

* There's a SCSS plugin, but I feel like using livereload would be better. Add a compass config file and a _src directory!
